# Lox in Lua

My implementation of [Lox language](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) in Lua.

It's mostly straight-forward translation of jlox to Lua, so some corner cases in semantics may be different (where Lua is different from Java).
Especially, runtime errors may be handled/reported differently.
